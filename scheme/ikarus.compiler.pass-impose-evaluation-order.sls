;;;; introduction
;;
;;This module does stuff:
;;
;;*  All  the  BIND struct  instances  in  the  input  expression are  processed  and
;;substituted with  code that evaluates the  RHS expressions and stores  their single
;;return value into  appropriately allocated Scheme stack machine words.   Here it is
;;decided in which order the RHS expressions are computed.
;;
;;* All the FUNCALL struct instances  in the input expression representing a function
;;call:
;;
;;   (funcall (asmcall mref
;;                    (constant (object ?loc))
;;                    (constant ?off-symbol-record-proc))
;;            (?rand ...))
;;
;;are converted to the equivalent of:
;;
;;   (bind ((tmp ?rand) ...)
;;     (funcall (asmcall mref
;;                      (constant (object ?loc))
;;                      (constant ?off-symbol-record-proc))
;;              (tmp ...)))
;;
;;so that the order of evaluation of the operands' expressions is decided.
;;
;;*  All  the  ASMCALL  struct  instances in  the  input  expression  representing  a
;;high-level Assembly instruction:
;;
;;   (asmcall ?instr (?rand ...))
;;
;;are converted to the equivalent of:
;;
;;   (bind ((tmp ?rand) ...)
;;     (asmcall ?instr (tmp ...)))
;;
;;so that the order of evaluation of the operands' expressions is decided.
;;
;;* Function  call instruction blocks  are inserted  to represent non-tail  calls and
;;tail-calls.
;;
;;* High-level Assembly  instructions requiring temporary locations  to store partial
;;results are expanded into more basic instructions.
;;
;;This  module accepts  as input  a  struct instance  of type  CODES, whose  internal
;;recordized code must be composed by struct instances of the following types:
;;
;;   bind		conditional		constant
;;   forcall		funcall			jmpcall
;;   asmcall		seq
;;   shortcut		var
;;
;;in addition CLOSURE-MAKER and CODE-LOC structs can appear in side CONSTANT structs.
;;
;;NOTE In this module  we create FVAR structs and NFV structs  in the recordised code
;;returned  to the  caller; such  structures will  be processed  in further  compiler
;;passes.  But *no* FVAR and NFV structs are present in the input recordised code.
;;
;;NOTE In the  returned recordised code: the ASM-INSTR structs  contain, as operands:
;;DISP structs,  FVAR structs,  CONSTANT structs,  symbols representing  CPU register
;;names, VAR structs with  LOC field set to #f.  Among these,  the DISP structs have:
;;as OBJREF field, a CONSTANT, FVAR, VAR struct or symbol representing a CPU register
;;name; as OFFSET field, a CONSTANT or VAR  struct.  The VAR structs in the DISP have
;;LOC field set to #f.

;;;; local values
;;
;;Some Assembly instructions generate result values  that must be stored somewhere to
;;be consumed  later; to represent  such machine words  we use VAR  structs.  Ideally
;;such temporary values are all stored in  CPU registers, but sometimes there are not
;;enough registers and we need to spill them on the Scheme stack.
;;
;;We usually  use the BIND  struct to represent the  need to allocate  such temporary
;;location.
;;
;;For every standalone expression  and body of CLAMBDA clause we  collect the list of
;;VAR structs representing such locations and store  it in the VARS field of a LOCALS
;;struct; we use the parameter LOCAL-VALUES to accumulate the list.
